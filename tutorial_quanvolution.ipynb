        "\n",
        "The *convolutional neural network* (CNN) is a standard model in\n",
        "classical machine learning which is particularly suitable for processing\n",
        "images. The model is based on the idea of a *convolution layer* where,\n",
        "instead of processing the full input data with a global function, a\n",
        "local convolution is applied.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the input is an image, small local regions are sequentially processed\n",
        "with the same kernel. The results obtained for each region are usually\n",
        "associated to different channels of a single output pixel. The union of\n",
        "all the output pixels produces a new image-like object, which can be\n",
        "further processed by additional layers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Quantum convolution\n",
        "\n",
        "One can extend the same idea also to the context of quantum variational\n",
        "circuits. A possible approach is given by the following procedure which\n",
        "is very similar to the one used in Ref. \\[1\\]. The scheme is also\n",
        "represented in the figure at the top of this tutorial.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  A small region of the input image, in our example a $2 \\times 2$\n",

        "    achieved with parametrized rotations applied to the qubits\n",
        "    initialized in the ground state.\n",

        "4.  Analogously to a classical convolution layer, each expectation value\n",
        "    is mapped to a different channel of a single output pixel.\n",
